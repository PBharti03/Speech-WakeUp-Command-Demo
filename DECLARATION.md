## Project Declaration


I, the creator of this project, declare that:


1. This project is a **demonstration app** meant for learning and experimentation purposes.
2. The app was built using **React** and **react-speech-recognition**, which relies on the **Web Speech API**.
3. The goal of this project is to show a **basic example** of how a browser can respond to a voice wake phrase and capture simple voice commands.
4. No private data, external APIs, or paid services are used.
5. The wake phrase detection and command capture logic is **na√Øve and simplified** ‚Äî it‚Äôs not meant for production use.


## Simple Explanation


Think of this project like a **tiny voice assistant** that wakes up when you say ‚Äúhey app.‚Äù It listens for a few quick commands, then goes back to waiting quietly if you stop talking for a few seconds. Everything happens right in your web browser ‚Äî no special setup or cloud connection needed just lan.

‚úÖ **You can use this app to learn how voice recognition works in browsers.**
üß† It‚Äôs simple, safe, and fun to experiment with!
