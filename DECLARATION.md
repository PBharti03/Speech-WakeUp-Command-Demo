## Project Declaration


I created this project, and here's what you should know:

1. It's a **demo app** meant for learning and experimentation purposes.
2. The app is built using **React** and **react-speech-recognition**, which relies on the **Web Speech API**.
3. The idea is to show how a browser can react to a voice wake phrase and grab simple voice commands.
4. No private data, external APIs, or paid services are used.
5. The wake phrase and command stuff is **simple.** It's not for real-world use.

# Simple Explanation

This project is like a **small voice helper** that wakes up when you say “hey app.” It listens for some commands, then goes back to waiting quietly if you stop talking for a few seconds.  It all happens in your browser - no setup or cloud needed.

**You can use this app to learn how voice recognition works in browsers.**
